\label{chap:Card-Sorting}

In general, card sorting is a technique in user experience. Participants 
of a study have to assign the different cards into the matching 
category, which is more or less a low-tech approach. 

It is mostly used for designing a navigation structure, but it can be used 
for evaluating an information architecture of a website or any other 
information structure, too.
A sample image of card sorting can be viewed in Figure~\ref{fig:sample}.

\section{Procedure}
Participants of a card sort study assign cards to categories. This can be done
either physically with paper or carton cards, or nowadays more often in digital
form where the user is given a list of cards and needs to assign them to groups.
The exact procedure depends on the defined variant.


\section{Variants}
There are three different types of card sorting. In closed card sorting 
the users have a fixed setup for the categories and in open card sorting 
they have to create the different categories for their own. But there is also 
a hybrid variant where you actually have a closed card sort but you are 
also be allowed to add additional custom categories.
