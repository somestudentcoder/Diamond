\TODO{Intro Text}
An academic survey paper presents a survey or overview of the state of
the art in a particular field. Every chapter and every section should
have some introductory text at the beginning, like this text. Never
jump straight in to the first secion or subsection without one or more
paragraphs of introductory text.






\section{Card Sorting}

\section{Tools} This chapter lists the tools in the card sorting field
that were reviewed in the process of this survey. These tools can be
further grouped by their functionalities. One tool, kardSort, is only
intended for the card sorting and offers no analytics at all. Some
other tools are only able to analyze previous card sort experiments,
but offer no sorting capabilities. Finally the remaining tools offer
both sorting and analytic capabilities. An overview can be seen in
Table~\ref{tab:reviewed-tools}.

\begin{table}[bp]

\begin{tabularx}

\end{table}

More tools were previewed before coming to a decision as to which
tools will be in the final survey. There were tools we were not able
to review as they are no longer available or have been acquired by
competitors. One tool, ~\textcite{UserZoom}, offers no free version
and did not answer to our inquiry for a review version. We listed all
tools that we looked at but did not review below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ~\parencite{SortIt} (not buildable)
    \item ~\parencite{UserZoom} (did not respond to inquiry)
    \item UsabilityTools UXSuite (acquired by competitor)
    \item ~\parencite{SimpleCardSort} (discontinued)
    \item ~\parencite{usabiliTest} (acquired by competitor)
    \item ConceptCodify (acquired by competitor)
\end{itemize}


\section{Review Process} The reviewing of tools was done in parallel
by three different  reviewers. In order to ensure streamlined reviews
and produce comparable results a review process was defined. Each
reviewer had to perform the same tasks and check for certain
pre-defined features. These features are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Participant limit
    \item Card limit
    \item Business model
    \item Availability of documentation
    \item Support for sub-categories
    \item Possibility for questionnaires
    \item Import data capabilities
    \item Export data capabilities
    \item User session playbacks
    \item Data preparation capabilities
    \item Types of analytical visualizations
\end{itemize}

Once a review had taken place. It was discussed
in a meeting with the other reviewers and ratings were assigned in
accordance with all members.

Each tool was tested with 2 datasets made up of two sets of cards. One
dataset is made up of 10 animals and the second is a list of 55 car
manufacturers. The cards were then used in open card sorting
experiments by the reviewers. The datasets can be viewed in Table
~\ref{tab:dataset-animal} and ~\ref{tab:dataset-car}.
