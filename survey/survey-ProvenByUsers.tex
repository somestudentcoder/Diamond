ProvenByUsers is another online card sorting tool that allows users to quickly 
create studies and export the resulting data. Their user interface is 
minimalistic but adquate and their analysis tools are quite extensive.

\section{Business Model}
All of their features can be accessed freely after creating an account, with the
only limitation being that only 3 results can be collected per survey. Since 3 
results are usually not enough, this means that a premium memberhip is necessary
for most purposes.

ProvenByUsers offers 3 different options for purchasing the option to have 
more than 3 participants per study. The frist one costs \$ 39.95 for 30 days, 
the second one costs \$ 69.95 for 60 days and the last option costs \$ 399.95 
for one year.

\section{Card Sorting}
Creating a card sorting study is relatively simple when using ProvenByUsers.
 Users are presented with a number of different fields that can customize 
 options. They are sorted into different categories than can be accessed via a 
 menu bar to the left and can be filled out in any order. 

The only notable problem we encoutered during the creation of a study, was 
that it is not possible to import the cards or categories as files, but rather 
have to be copied and pasted into a text field. This is especially unintuitive 
if one wants to create a study with several layers of sub-categories as the 
text has to be in a specific format. 

However, that was the only problem and their documentation has a very detailed 
explanation of all the fields that have to be filled out. Overall, there are a 
lot of cusotmization options, including quenstionaires before or after the 
survey, color and style choices and a number of messages that can be displayed 
at varying points before, during or after the survey.

\section{Analytics}
Even before a study has closed, it is possible to review the results of every 
person who has participated in the study so far. ProvenByUsers allows users to 
view the data in a number of different ways.as well as some more analytical 
tools such as a similarity matrix, a dendrogram and a maximum agreement table. 
Users can be individually included or excluded in all of these results and all 
results, except the dendrogram, can be exported as either CSV or Syncaps
 file format (see chapter \ref{chap:SynCaps}).

\section{Summary \& Ratings}
ProvenByUsers is relatively easy to use and offers a very detailed written 
documentation. There are a large number of cusomization options when creating a 
stduy, as well as a good number of analysis tools. 

As with \textcite{UXtweak}, there are no major downsides to using this tool, but
because they only allow 3 participants per study, it is basically required to 
buy a premium membership. This time however, it is not possible to conduct 
smaller studies without paying, as 3 participants simply is not enough to make 
any statements with high confidence.
